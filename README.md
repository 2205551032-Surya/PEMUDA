# About this Capstone Project

Unemployment is a problem exacerbated by global economic changes, limited access to information, skill mismatches, and the challenges of job locations far from home. **PEMUDA** is here to address these issues by providing a job recommendation system tailored to users' skills and areas of residence. Managed using dummy data, PEMUDA focuses on regencies in Bali, offering job recommendations based on skills and location.

## Bangkit Product-based Capstone Project

PeMuda is built as a requirement for Bangkit 2024's Product-based Capstone Project. This repository is built as an all-in-one access for every repository used by this project (links to each repo are included below).
