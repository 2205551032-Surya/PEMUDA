We develop a Content-Based Filtering model with TensorFlow.js is built to provide job recommendations based on the user's skills and location. Preprocessing includes merging occupation and region data, skill conversion, tokenization and padding. Cosine similarity is then calculated to measure the similarity between jobs. The model is built using a neural network with embedding for skills and location, followed by a dense layer to generate a binary match score.
